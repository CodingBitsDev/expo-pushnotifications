# Modified Sample snack expo 36

This example was provided my expo in their lates documentation for expo v36 regarding push notification.
In [this](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/#eventsubscription) page this [snack](https://snack.expo.io/@documentation/pushnotifications?platform=ios)
was linked as an example on how to achieve Push notifications.

This worked up to the version 35, but not in the newes vesion 36.

In this example I updated the to version 36 using *expo upgrade*. And send Push notifications to it using the [Expo notification Tool](https://expo.io/notifications).

# The Problem

When the app is previously closed and the notification is "selected" on android, the Notifications Listener will not be called.
